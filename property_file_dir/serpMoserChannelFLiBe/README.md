This directory contains group constants for the FOM-maximizing (figure of merit)
FLiBe channel. The optimal infinite lattice has a pitch of 34.0 cm in a hexagonal lattice
with a channel radius of about 8.4676 cm, in other words a salt fraction of 0.225.
The optimization and composition of the salt/moderator can be found in:

The group constants are generated in the four group structure called "option 1" described in:
